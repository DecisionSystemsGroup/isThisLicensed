# isThisLicensed

About
-----
**isThisLicensed** is a project for the [hack.summit()](https://hacksummit.org/) [virtual hackathon](http://www.koding.com/hackathon) that allows you to check if an image you upload is licensed somewhere in the web. 

Furthermore, content creators can import their images directly through their flickr account. After the import they get to choose which license they prefer for their work or they can keep their licenses from flickr.
